### Some setup instructions
- See the [wiki](https://github.com/coyoteclan/cod1-battleroyale/wiki)

___
### Some TODO
- Prevent players from getting stuck in each other when exiting plane
  - MiscMod's [_newspawn function](https://github.com/cato-a/CoDaM_MiscMod/blob/4db1d420b87b766eb9bffb352a7d9c13eaa0c851/___CoDaM_MiscMod/codam/_mm_mmm.gsc#L379) might help
- Make the zone to move when shrinking
- Fill roofs and holes on the map
- Show the full zone on compass instead of just the center
- Create models and animations for skydiving
  - applying animations might require to add a `setAnim` GSC command to CoDExtended, like libcod
- Fix the bugs that you may find :)
Tell us the bugs you may find and we will fix them.
